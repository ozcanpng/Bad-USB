# What is Bad-USB?
Bad USB is a type of attack and a type of malicious hardware (malware) that exploits USB devices for malicious purposes.


Bad USB is usually designed to look similar to common USB devices such as USB memory drives, keyboards, mice or other USB devices. However, these devices can perform undesirable actions when plugged into a computer.

# Purpose
In this project, we will see what we can do with the Raspberry Pi Pico device, which does everything that the USB Rubber Ducky device can do and is quite low cost.

I wanted to compile and show what kind of Payloads are useful in what kind of scenarios rather than how the device is set up. 

The scenario where the device is most powerful is where we have physical access. There really are no limits to what we can do where we have physical access. 

# Legal Notice
A small reminder, please use the resources in this project for education and self-improvement. Otherwise, please note that there are legal sanctions :)

# Saving time where we have physical access 

- We can run the codes we want 

- We can turn off the antivirus 

- We can crash the operating system by deleting system files 

- We can watch his camera 

- The victim can download files from the computer 

- We can upload files to the victim computer

- We can create/delete files from the victim computer  

# Device and Installation
For those who are curious about the device, you can [click here](https://www.amazon.com.tr/Raspberry-Pi-SC0915-Pico/dp/B09KVB8LVR/ref=asc_df_B09KVB8LVR/?tag=trshpngglede-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=510499475756&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5826631902843730337&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9056808&hvtargid=pla-1596335753242&psc=1&mcid=b7261fa1640b3b5bbecaa0daa4137f37) to find out the current price and look at the [project](https://github.com/ozcanpng/pico-ducky) I have given for the installation of the device and see how it is installed.

# Payloads
The Payloads you have downloaded work under the name and extension “payload.dd” and you can see all Payloads [here](https://github.com/ozcanpng/Bad-USB/tree/main/Payloads).

Below is an example video showing what you can do with the “Wifi+Sysinfo+IPinfo.dd” Payload.
